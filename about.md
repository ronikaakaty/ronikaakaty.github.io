<p>Hello, my name is Roni. My background is in the healthcare industry, however I've always had a fascination with numbers. I've always enjoyed looking over data and trying to figure out what story is being told. That's what brought me to the data science field. I finally found an area that links my passion of sports with my love of data. I'm eager to grow and see what else this industry has for me. </p>
